## Introduction

Vim-outline parse your current buffer and slam an outline in a side-window.
That's all!

<!-- Well, in reality is not, in-fact Vim-outline further provides you with the -->
<!-- following features: -->

<!-- 1. Locate your current position on the outline, -->
<!-- 2. Jump from outline entries to the corresponding buffer lines, -->
<!-- 3. Feed you with random motivational quote if a *filetype* is not supported. -->
<!--    [Cringe mode ON!] -->

The outline is far from being perfect, but it gives you a good idea of how
your code is structured and it allows you to jump from one place to another.
It is perhaps the plugin that I use more!

At the moment the supported language are `python`, `vim9script`, `tex` and
`markdown`. For non supported languages, you will be entertained with some
famous quotes every time you attempt to trigger the outline window.

Nevertheless, if you really don't like the quotes, and you are good with regex
and you want to add support for another language you are welcome to send PR:s!
Take a look at`:h OutlineAddNewLanguages` for more details.

<!-- At the time I was working with Python and Vim9script, hence Python and -->
<!-- Vim9Script are supported by default, but you can easily add other languages. -->
<!-- See `:h OutlineAddNewLanguages`. -->

<!-- I wrote vim-outline mainly for myself because I had some issue when using -->
<!-- Vista! with ALE and Tagbar require ctags, which is a tool that I don't -->
<!-- have installed (I know, I should). -->

<!-- What I needed was a self-contained tool (i.e. no-dependencies), which is -->
<!-- easily configurable, fast and reliable and that would support me to get -->
<!-- my job done, no matter if lacks bells and whistles and if the outcome -->
<!-- is an imprecise sketch with noisy entries. -->

<!-- If you work with Data Science you may also want to take a look at -->
<!-- [vim-replica](https://github.com/ubaldot/vim-replica). -->

## Installation

Use any plugin manager or the builtin Vim plugin manager.

## Requirements

Vim-outline is written in _Vim9script_, therefore you need at least _Vim 9.0_.
That is pretty much all. No ctags, nor LSP servers required.

## Usage

#### Commands

`:OutlineToggle` open/close a side-window that shows an outline of your
current buffer.

`:OutlineJump` jump on the outline window. Such a command is handy when you
have different windows open in the same tab and you want to jump directly to
the outline window with one key-press.

`:OutlineRefresh` update outline & locate yourself.

#### Mappings

```
# Default mappings
nmap <silent> <F8> <Plug>OutlineToggle
nmap <silent> <leader>l <Plug>OutlineRefresh
nmap <silent> <leader>o <Plug>OutlineGoToOutline
```

> **Note** The refresh is asynchronous, meaning that outline & localization
> are automatically updated only in response to the following events:
>
> 1. Newly opened outline,
> 2. Another buffer is entered,
>
> In all the other cases, you have to refresh it manually through
> `:OutlineRefresh`. See `:h OutlineUsage` for more info.

## Configuration

<!-- For each filetype you can define some regex to be used to parse the -->
<!-- current buffer through the following dictionaries: -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- # Default values -->
<!-- g:outline_pattern_to_include = {"python": ['^class', '^\s*def'], -->
<!--                                 \  "vim": ['^\s*export', '^\s*def', '^\S*map', -->
<!--                                 \           '^\s*\(autocmd\|autocommand\)', -->
<!--                                 \           '^\s*\(command\|cmd\)', '^\s*sign' -->
<!--                                 ]} -->

<!-- g:outline_pattern_to_exclude = {"python": ['^\s*def\s_\{-1,2}'], "vim": -->
<!-- ['^\s*#'] } -->

<!-- g:outline_include_before_exclude = {"python": false, "vim": false} -->
<!-- ``` -->

You only have few tweaking variables:

```# Default values
g:outline_buf_name = "Outline!"
g:outline_win_size = &columns / 4
g:outline_enable_highlight = true
```

See `:h OutlineConfiguration` for more info.

<!-- > **Warning** -->
<!-- > The default values are overwritten by user values! -->
<!-- > To see the current setting of a variable run `:echo g:<variable_name>`, for -->
<!-- > example `:echo g:outline_pattern_to_exclude`. -->

## Can I use it for languages that are not supported yet?

Yes, it _should_ work... with a little hack. <br> I hope it won't bother you
too much!<br>

As an example, I'll show you how to hack it for `.cpp` files, but the same
principle should apply, _mutatis-mutandis_, to any other filetype.

#### Step 1

Create a `cpp.vim` file in `.vim/ftplugin` with the following content

```
vim9script

def FilterOutline(outline: list<string>): list<string>
    return outline ->filter("v:val =~ "
    \ .. string(join(g:outline_pattern_to_include["cpp"], '|')))
enddef

b:FilterOutline = FilterOutline
```

#### Step 2

Add the following to your `.vimrc`

```
extend(g:outline_pattern_to_include, {"cpp": ['<KEEP-ME!>']})
```

#### Step 3

Comment each line that you want to show in the outline with `// <KEEP-ME!>`

At this point, call `:OutlineToggle` (or hit `<F8>` if you are using the
default mapping) and see what happens. Jumps and localization functions should
work automatically.
